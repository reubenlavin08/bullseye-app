"""eBay comps adapter — sold-price comp lookups via the Finding API.

Mirrors the shape of `comps/marketplace.py`:

  get_ebay_comps(search_term=...) → CompStats

Same TTL cache (12h default) backed by the same `comps` table; rows are
distinguished from Marketplace rows by `source='ebay'`. Callers can
decide which source to prefer (typically eBay > Marketplace because
sold > asking).

Disabled gracefully: if EBAY_APP_ID isn't set or the Finding API call
errors out, returns an empty CompStats so the appraisal pipeline can
fall back to Marketplace comps without crashing.

    """Get the best comp data for an FB Marketplace target listing.

    Decision rule: prefer eBay (better product matching), fall back to
    Marketplace if eBay is sparse.

    Why eBay-primary even though scores skew higher:
      User wants product-match accuracy over distribution shape. eBay
      listings include brand/model/condition explicitly, so when we
      search 'Dlink R15 Router' on eBay we get actual Dlink R15
      Router listings — not 'random Marketplace listings whose title
      happens to contain Dlink'. The slight upward skew in scores is
      acceptable because the underlying comp set is a far more
      faithful comparison. User can raise their score threshold (e.g.
      from 90 to 95) to filter out the 'merely average' tier.

    Trade-off acknowledged:
      eBay listings tend to be ~20-30% higher than Marketplace asking
      for the same item (shipping, new items, retail-style sellers).
      A Marketplace target will land in eBay's lower percentiles
      → inflated deal_score. The trade is: better product identity
      match (signal) at the cost of less spread (precision in the
      tails). Tune via score_threshold if it becomes noisy.

    Tunables:
      MIN_EBAY_PRIMARY (default 3) — minimum eBay sample to use it
      as primary. Below that, we fall back to Marketplace which
      tends to have more samples for non-branded niche keywords.
      Was 5; reduced to 3 once parts/accessory exclusion got
      aggressive enough to halve the sample on niche product names
      ("iRobot Roomba i5" went from 30 noisy → 4 clean comps). 3
      genuine-match comps beat 30 parts-polluted ones.
